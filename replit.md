### Monorepo Structure
The application follows a monorepo pattern with three main directories:
- `client/` - Frontend React application
- `server/` - Backend Express API
- `shared/` - Common types and schemas shared between frontend and backend

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The system manages five core entities:
1. **Users** - Loan officers and administrators
2. **Borrowers** - Loan applicants with contact information
3. **Properties** - Real estate assets being financed
4. **Loan Applications** - Core loan processing records with status tracking
5. **Documents** - File attachments and supporting documentation
6. **Tasks** - Workflow management and assignment tracking

### Loan Processing Pipeline
- **Application Stage**: Initial loan request and borrower information
- **Document Review**: Collection and verification of required documents
- **Underwriting**: Financial analysis and risk assessment
- **Approval/Decline**: Final decision and terms setting

### Authentication & Authorization
- Role-based access control with loan officer and administrator roles
- Session-based authentication for secure user management

## Data Flow

1. **Loan Application Creation**: Borrowers submit applications through the frontend form
2. **Document Upload**: Supporting documents are uploaded and stored in the filesystem
3. **Workflow Management**: Tasks are assigned to loan officers for processing
4. **Status Updates**: Application status is tracked through the pipeline stages
5. **Dashboard Analytics**: Real-time statistics and reporting for management oversight
